# Special Milestone

Executing an integration build and unit test on the build server is all well and good but before we can 
say a build is complete and ready to go, its a good idea to know if it will work after deployment.

For Special milestone, we are planning to do smoke testing for the deployed application. Some testing is done 
inorder to check 
1. If the application is running 
2. The correct version of code is deployed or not.

Executing a test deployment and then smoke testing will ensure that the archived build is ready to be deployed on 
test and production environments.

We used selenium to do smoke testing. Selenium is an open source technology for automating browser based applications.
It can also be used to perform load and performance tests.
